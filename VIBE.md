## What's Happening

Some of this I'm writing in Cursor, using Claude (with my personal
account). And other parts I am writing as I would normally, using
Emacs.  I try to keep track of how much assistance Claude has been in
the development of any given module.

I wrote an original set of goals as a prompt for this project, and
that was used to generate GOALS.md and README.md

I wrote a set of rules about unit testing as a prompt, and that was
used to generate tests/TESTING_RULES.md

This project is WIP, and there's some generated code I have no
intention of using but still haven't gotten around to re-writing.


## Vibe Coding Tiers

It's not particularly scientific, but here's my tier system.

0. Pure Human - This means I wrote every single piece of it. Claude
   may have scanned it at some point, or even in review mentioned it
   in a report, but only I have edited it.

1. AI Assisted, Mostly Human - This means that I'll let Claude tweak
   the file, but for the most part I'm writing the code myself

2. AI Generated with Human Rework - This means Claude spat out the
   majority of the file, and I've just been tweaking it as needed

3. AI Generated - This is mostly unit tests and things I haven't
   gotten to yet. I let Claude spit out the whole thing and manage
   changes in it.

<!-- The end. -->
