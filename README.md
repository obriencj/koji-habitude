# koji-habitude

**ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§**

This project is *not* production ready. It's coming along fast, but there are
challenges cropping up all of the time. Until this project has a version of 1.0,
do not attempt to use it with a production Koji instance.

However, if you have a test instance you want to try it on, give that a go and
let me know!


## Overview

koji-habitude is a configuration management tool for
[Koji](https://pagure.io/koji) build systems. It provides a declarative approach
to managing koji objects through YAML templates and data files, with intelligent
dependency resolution and tiered execution.

**Key Features:**
- Define koji objects (tags, external repos, users, targets, hosts, groups) in
  YAML
- Use Jinja2 templates for dynamic configuration generation
- Automatically resolve dependencies between objects (tag inheritance)
- Preview template expansion results with the `expand` command
- Apply changes in the correct order through tiered execution
- Validate configurations offline before deployment

This project is an offshoot of [koji-box](https://github.com/obriencj/koji-box),
fulfilling the need for populating a boxed koji instance with a bunch of tags
and targets. However it is being written such that it can be used with any koji
instance, in the hopes that it may bring joy into the lives of those trying to
keep projects packagers happy.


## Current Status

**Implemented:**
- Complete CLI framework with all core commands (`apply`, `compare`, `expand`,
  `list-templates`)
- All Koji object types (8 CORE_MODELS) with Pydantic validation
- Dependency resolution architecture (Resolver and Solver modules)
- Processor module with state machine and multicall integration
- Comprehensive unit testing (360 tests, 74% coverage)
- Template expansion and change tracking system

**Next Steps:**
- CLI testing coverage improvements
- Integration testing on a real koji instance
- Performance optimization and error handling improvements


## CLI Commands

koji-habitude is built using [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) and
provides four main commands plus a template subcommand group for working with
individual templates.


### Main Commands

**`apply`** - Apply changes to Koji hub
```bash
koji-habitude apply [OPTIONS] DATA [DATA...]
```
- Loads templates and data files with dependency resolution
- Applies changes to koji hub in the correct order
- Options: `--templates PATH`, `--profile PROFILE`, `--show-unchanged`, `--skip-phantoms`

**`compare`** - Show differences (dry-run)
```bash
koji-habitude compare [OPTIONS] DATA [DATA...]
```
- Same processing as apply but without making changes
- Provides detailed change analysis and dependency reporting
- Options: `--templates PATH`, `--profile PROFILE`, `--show-unchanged`

**`expand`** - Expand templates to YAML
```bash
koji-habitude expand [OPTIONS] DATA [DATA...]
```
- Expands templates and outputs final YAML to stdout
- Options: `--templates PATH`, `--validate`, `--select TYPE`

**`list-templates`** - List available templates
```bash
koji-habitude list-templates [OPTIONS] [PATH...]
```
- Lists templates with their configuration details
- Options: `--templates PATH`, `--yaml`, `--full`, `--select NAME`


### Template Subcommands

Work with individual templates by name:

**`template show`** - Show template definition
```bash
koji-habitude template show [OPTIONS] NAME
```
- Displays the definition of a single template
- Options: `--templates PATH`, `--yaml`

**`template expand`** - Expand single template
```bash
koji-habitude template expand [OPTIONS] NAME [KEY=VALUE...]
```
- Expands a template with given variables and outputs YAML
- Options: `--templates PATH`, `--validate`

**`template compare`** - Compare single template
```bash
koji-habitude template compare [OPTIONS] NAME [KEY=VALUE...]
```
- Expands and compares a template against koji (dry-run)
- Options: `--templates PATH`, `--profile PROFILE`, `--show-unchanged`

**`template apply`** - Apply single template
```bash
koji-habitude template apply [OPTIONS] NAME [KEY=VALUE...]
```
- Expands and applies a template to koji
- Options: `--templates PATH`, `--profile PROFILE`, `--show-unchanged`


### Common Patterns
- `DATA`: Directories or files containing YAML definitions
- `--templates PATH`: Additional template locations (can be repeated)
- `--profile PROFILE`: Koji profile to use (default: 'koji')
- `--show-unchanged`: Include objects that don't need changes


## YAML Format & Templates

YAML files can be single or multi-document, processed in-order. Each document
has a 'type' key indicating the document type. Default types are 'template',
'tag', 'target', 'user', 'group', 'host', and 'external-repo'. Templates define
new types based on their name.


### Template System

Templates use [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) for dynamic content
generation:

**Inline Template:**
```yaml
---
type: template
name: my-template
content: |
  ---
  type: tag
  name: {{ name }}
  inheritance:
    {% for parent in parents %}
    - name: {{ parent }}
      priority: {{ loop.index * 10 }}
    {% endfor %}
```

**External Template:**
```yaml
---
type: template
name: my-template
file: my-template.j2
```

**Template Usage:**
```yaml
---
type: my-template
name: fedora-42-build
parents:
  - fedora-42-base
  - fedora-42-updates
```

When processing data files, objects with `type` matching a template name trigger
template expansion, creating final koji objects through recursive processing.


## Supported Types & Architecture


### Core Koji Object Types

koji-habitude supports all core Koji object types with fully implemented
Pydantic models:

- **`tag`**: Build tags with inheritance chains and external repositories
- **`external-repo`**: External package repositories with URL validation
- **`user`**: Koji users and permissions with group membership
- **`target`**: Build targets linking build and destination tags
- **`host`**: Build hosts and their configurations with architecture support
- **`group`**: Package groups and their memberships
- **`channel`**: Build channels with host assignments
- **`permission`**: User permission definitions


### Dependency Resolution

The system automatically detects dependencies between objects and provides
intelligent resolution:

- **Resolver Module**: Handles external dependencies and creates placeholders
  for missing objects
- **Solver Module**: Creates tiered execution plans with priority-based ordering
- **Automatic Splitting**: Cross-tier dependencies are resolved through object
  splitting
- **Tiered Execution**: Objects are processed in dependency-resolved tiers to
  ensure proper ordering


### Architecture Components

- **Template System**: Jinja2-based template expansion with recursive processing
- **Processor Module**: State machine-driven synchronization engine with
  multicall integration
- **Change Tracking**: `ChangeReport` system tracks all modifications with
  detailed explanations
- **Dry-Run Support**: `CompareOnlyProcessor` for previewing changes without
  applying them

**Data Flow**: YAML files â†’ Template expansion â†’ Dependency resolution â†’ Tiered
processing
