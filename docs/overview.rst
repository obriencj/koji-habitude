koji-habitude
=============

**ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§**

This project is *not* production ready. Itâ€™s coming along fast, but
there are challenges cropping up all of the time. Until this project has
a version of 1.0, do not attempt to use it with a production Koji
instance.

However, if you have a test instance you want to try it on, give that a
go and let me know!

Overview
--------

koji-habitude is an object management tool for
`Koji <https://pagure.io/koji>`__ build systems. It provides a
declarative approach to managing koji objects through YAML templates and
data files.

This project is an offshoot of
`koji-box <https://github.com/obriencj/koji-box>`__, fulfilling the need
for populating a boxed koji instance with a bunch of tags and targets.
However it is being written such that it can be used with any koji
deployment, in the hopes that it may bring joy into the lives of those
trying to keep project packagers happy.

**Key Features:**

- Define koji objects (tags, external repos, users, targets, hosts,
  groups, channels, permissions, build types, archive types) in YAML
- Use Jinja2 templates for dynamic configuration generation
- Automatically resolve dependencies between objects (tag inheritance)
- Apply changes in the correct order through tiered execution
- Validate configurations offline before deployment

Current Status
--------------

As noted before, this project is still a work-in-progress, but most of
the core features have been implemented. Some are still being refined,
but overall it is in an operational state.

**Implemented:**

- CLI framework with the essential commands
- 11 primary Koji object types are implemented, with both local and
  remote representations
- Templates and template calls are functional
- Dependency-aware ordering works
- Reference detection (eg. if you inherit from a tag you donâ€™t define)
- Middling unit testing coverage (419 tests, 72% coverage)

**Next Steps:**

- CLI testing coverage improvements
- Further integration testing on real koji instance
- Documentation

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

koji-habitude provides a comprehensive CLI built with
`Click <https://click.palletsprojects.com/>`__ for managing Koji
objects. The CLI includes:

- **Primary commands**: ``apply``, ``compare``, ``expand``, ``fetch``,
  ``dump``, ``list-templates``, ``diff``
- **Template subcommands**: Work with individual templates using
  ``template show``, ``template expand``, ``template compare``,
  ``template diff``, ``template apply``

For detailed CLI documentation with all options, examples, and use
cases, see the `Command-Line Interface
documentation <../cli/>`__ in the full documentation.

YAML Format & Templates
-----------------------

YAML files can be single or multi-document, processed in-order. Each
document has a ``type`` key indicating the document type. Core types
include ``template``, ``tag``, ``target``, ``user``, ``group``,
``host``, ``channel``, ``permission``, ``content-generator``,
``build-type``, ``archive-type``, and ``external-repo``. Templates
define new types based on their name.

Templates use `Jinja2 <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/>`__ for
dynamic content generation, allowing you to create reusable patterns for
koji objects. When processing data files, objects with ``type`` matching
a template name trigger template expansion, creating final koji objects
through recursive processing.

For complete YAML format documentation and detailed examples, see the
`YAML Format Specification <../yaml_format/>`__ in the full
documentation.

Architecture
------------

koji-habitude supports all core Koji object types with fully implemented
Pydantic models: tags, external repos, users, targets, hosts, groups,
channels, permissions, content generators, build types, and archive
types.

The system automatically detects dependencies between objects (e.g., tag
inheritance) and provides intelligent resolution through tiered
execution, ensuring objects are processed in the correct order. The
architecture includes:

- **Template System**: Jinja2-based template expansion with recursive
  processing
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic detection and tiered execution
  ordering
- **Remote Models**: Complete set of remote object models for fetching
  and comparing
- **State Synchronization**: State machine-driven processor with
  multicall integration
- **Change Tracking**: Detailed tracking of all modifications with
  explanations
- **Dry-Run Support**: Preview changes without applying them
- **Bidirectional**: Fetch remote state to YAML, or dump remote objects
  by pattern

**Data Flow**: YAML files â†’ Template expansion â†’ Dependency resolution â†’
Tiered processing â†’ Koji hub
