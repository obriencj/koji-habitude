# Release 0.9.0

The first stable pre-release of koji habitude! From here we'll be working to
add features and polish out bugs, but the general usage interface should be
stable. No explicit promises for API compatibility are in place until 1.0.0,
but nothing drastic should change between here and there.

Hit that tracker for ideas and issues! Now is the best time to provide
feedback.

## Features

- Initial release of koji-habitude
- CLI interface for managing koji objects
- YAML-based configuration with Jinja2 template support
- Support for core koji object types (tags, targets, users, groups, hosts,
  channels, permissions, external repos, content generators, build types,
  archive types)
- Automatic dependency resolution and tiered execution
- Template expansion system
- Remote state fetching and comparison
- Change tracking and dry-run support
